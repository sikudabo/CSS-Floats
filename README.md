# CSS-Floats
This short project highlights the power of floats in CSS3. Floats can help us manage where elements go in a CSS page. Due to new CSS designs, floats are not my favorite choice, but they can still be useful. This projects also shows how CSS can be used to create rows and columns (a form of a grid system) in CSS. For example, the main part of this page has two rows that each have 2 columns. In CSS a row can have 12 columns and elements in those rows can take up a certain number of columns. In our layout the media objects take up 6 columns (or 50% width) which gives us a nicely formatted 2x2 layout design. Lastly, this layout shows a modern CSS design that is common on most websites today. That is something called a "media object". This is simply an image that is floated to the left and text that describes that image to the right of it. This is a common design that you will see on many websites today (GrubHub menus would be an example with an image of the food item floated to the left and a description of the item to the right). Floats can help us achieve this design, but you need to set overflow to auto around the text or else the text will wrap around the  image, similar to what you see in a newspaper article. You are free to use this sample code to practice the grid system design. ![SITE IMAGE](https://github.com/sikudabo/CSS-Floats/blob/master/Screenshot%20(13).png)
